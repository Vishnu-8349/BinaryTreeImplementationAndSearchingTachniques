#  Binary Tree Implementation and Searching Techniques

This project demonstrates the construction and traversal of binary trees using core searching techniques such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. It showcases how trees can be implemented from scratch and traversed using multiple strategies.

##  Features

- Binary Tree construction using `TreeNode` class
- **BFS Traversal** (Level-order)
- **DFS Traversals**:
  - Pre-Order
  - In-Order
  - Post-Order
- Console outputs for visualizing tree traversal order

##  Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard libraries (e.g., `queue`, `stack`)
- Compiler: g++, clang++, or any C++ IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks)

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishnu-8349/BinaryTreeImplementationAndSearchingTachniques.git
   cd BinaryTreeImplementationAndSearchingTachniques
